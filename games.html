      <h1>Nerf ArenaBlast Level Design</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Nerf ArenaBlast is a highly modifiable 1999 Unreal Engine first person arena shooter. I've worked extensively on upgrading and upkeeping the game ever since it became abandonware. In this section, you'll see some of my work in level design and get a look at some of the nuanced  theories that go into designing an artistically inspired arena.</h5>
      <div class="popup-gallery">
	<a href="images/games/levels/shot1.png" title="My maps span a huge range of themes. Only once did I experiment with a total lack of lighting. The walls and obstacles of this arena had to be defined entirely with only contrasts."><img src="images/games/levels/shot1.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot2.png" title="On the other end of the spectrum is an arena will very few walls. Players have to scramble across this Bond-villain-style satellite to the sparse cover."><img src="images/games/levels/shot2.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot3.png" title="One of my favorite parts of designing a space is creating an interesting backdrop. In this area one can see a number of unreachable details including a wrecking-ball in the middle of knocking down a wall. These kinds of details pleasingly cover the transition between the arena and the unreachable skybox."><img src="images/games/levels/shot3.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot4.png" title="Creating convincing decay is a challenge in this old of an engine. With a little patience and careful arrangement of a scene, one can pull it off. And when you do, it can add a very nice atmospheric touch."><img src="images/games/levels/shot4.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot5.png" title="I like my levels to tell a little story. In this map I imagined how a place like this might come to be discovered. Perhaps someone exploring a cave fell through this weakened floor. Details like this unreachable exit make an arena feel more like part of a tangible world."><img src="images/games/levels/shot5.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot6.png" title="Even within an extremely old game, dramatic lighting can make for a really interesting focal point."><img src="images/games/levels/shot6.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot7.png" title="I like to take something mundane and mix it with something fantastic. While the underdeveloped rough draft for this map came from another mapper, when I updated it visually I decided to lean into the floating aspect of the main structure. Players can now attribute the aerial status of this bridge to a supervillain's gravity beam gone wrong."><img src="images/games/levels/shot7.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/levels/shot8.png" title="I like to mix some of the disperate default and community-created textures to make new atmospheres in maps. Here I've taken the fantastic tropical default texture pack and mixed it with some more industrial touches to make an interesting underwater exhibit."><img src="images/games/levels/shot8.png" width="225" height="150"></a>

      <h1>Nerf ArenaBlast High Resolution PBR Texture Remakes</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">As I continue to update the game, I'm able to push the engine more and more. The latest version of the game now supports high resolution physically based rendering. Below you'll see some of my efforts to recreate the tiny, low-detail textures in a new high resolution incarnation but with a familiar style.</h5>
		<div class="popup-gallery">
        <a href="images/games/hires/Compare0.png" title="When updating textures from old games to physically based rendering, the most important change is removing the pre-baked lighting that the original artist added to the textures. My new textures will react to the light that hits them, creating real-time scattering of light that conveys the depth and roughness of the material."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare0.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
	<a href="images/games/hires/Compare1.png" title="Nerf ArenaBlast takes place in a universe where Nerf matches have become a huge spectator sport. It's only appropriate that many of the materials used in the game resemble foam and plastic. Face-on, these materials don't look too different from their decades-old counterparts."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare1.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
	<a href="images/games/hires/Compare2.png" title="But once the light starts to hit these materials, the magic happens. Each module in this texture receives different lighting calculations once in the game engine, giving the surface a realistic feeling of depth that doesn't stray too far from the original's look and feel."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare2.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
	<a href="images/games/hires/Compare3.png" title="Here a boring concrete becomes an interesting mixed material. Since this texture is used in an asteroid-mining space station, I thought it only appropriate to add in flecks of a metallic material similar to that found in meteorites."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare3.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/hires/ingame.png" title="There is still much to do to get the rendering engine to display these materials perfectly, but one can already see the difference a physically rendered texture can make to the realism of lighting."><img src="images/games/hires/ingame.png" width="225" height="150"></a>
    <a href="images/games/hires/Compare4.png" title="Sometimes, the source textures are so small that a lot of creative artistic license is needed to re-imagine them in higher detail. Here is one possible iteration on a rough idea. While this isn't a finished conversion, it gives me a good idea what direction I should go in."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare4.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
<a href="images/games/hires/Compare5.png" title="It's not trivial to get just the right mixture of accuracy to the source and high detail. This texture looks simple, but could be tweaked in a number of subtle ways to more closely resemble the fantasy material it is made of."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare5.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
<a href="images/games/hires/Compare6.png" title="Interpreting the depth of a 2D source texture can be difficult, but rewarding. Height mapping adds new life to a boring material."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare6.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
<a href="images/games/hires/Compare7.png" title="A common problem with the old source textures is that they were created with extremely dark, saturated, low-detail shadows. One has to lighten things up and let the lighting engine handle making the surfaces darker dynamically."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare7.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
<a href="images/games/hires/Compare8.png" title="In the end I still want the new materials to feel like the style of the old ones. It is a delicate balancing act to introduce detail without sacrificing style."><img src="images/games/hires/Compare8.png" width="150" height="150"></a>
